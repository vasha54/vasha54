**description:**  At the University of Informatics Sciences, Faculty 5 has several production centers among which is the Center for Industrial Informatics 
(CEDIN) where the Guardian of the ALBA (GALBA), which had the task of providing a solution to the development of a SCADA in conjunction with the PDVSA 
company.

The Human Machine Interface or HMI (Human Machine Interface) is the module of the GALBA SCADA system that allows configuring, supervising and controlling industrial processes. The HMI provides a library ofgraphic components (CG) that make it possible to recreate as realistically as possible the processes that they occur in plants. These graphics can be simple geometric primitives or as complex as industrial components used in the industry that you want to monitor. The CGs consist of certain limitation due to its current product design and implementation that are defined by specialists and leaves open to developers its implementation mechanisms and design.

The work was based on the development of a mechanism for incorporating SVG graphics into the HMI of SCADA GALBA with the purpose of solving the limitations present in the graphic components of the HMI. The development of the mechanism is supported by the agile XP methodology with the use of the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) standard and Qt framework.}
