## Thesis

**Title:** Mechanism for incorporating SVG graphics into the SCADA GALBA HMI.

**Tutors:** Eng. Roberto Cardenas Isla, Eng. Ariel Guerra Garayta

**Description:**  At the University of Informatics Sciences, Faculty 5 has several production centers among which is the Center for Industrial Informatics 
(CEDIN) where the Guardian of the ALBA (GALBA), which had the task of providing a solution to the development of a SCADA in conjunction with the PDVSA 
company.

The Human Machine Interface or HMI (Human Machine Interface) is the module of the GALBA SCADA system that allows configuring, supervising and controlling industrial processes. The HMI provides a library ofgraphic components (CG) that make it possible to recreate as realistically as possible the processes that they occur in plants. These graphics can be simple geometric primitives or as complex as industrial components used in the industry that you want to monitor. The CGs consist of certain limitation due to its current product design and implementation that are defined by specialists and leaves open to developers its implementation mechanisms and design.

The work was based on the development of a mechanism for incorporating SVG graphics into the HMI of SCADA GALBA with the purpose of solving the limitations present in the graphic components of the HMI. The development of the mechanism is supported by the agile XP methodology with the use of the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) standard and Qt framework.

## Master's Thesis

**Title:** ROFLEXIN/LC System Man-Machine Interface Viewer for Mobile Devices.

**Tutors:** Ph.D Ramón Quiza Sardiñas

**Description:** The Center for Studies on Advanced and Sustainable Manufacturing (CEFAS) of the University of Matanzas develops the ROFLEXIN/LC project: Robust, flexible and intelligent, low-cost system for monitoring systems and mechanical processes. This project is fundamentally aimed at small and medium-sized companies, where the use of the alternatives available in the world market is not financially feasible. The present investigation arises from the need of the personnel that uses the ROFLEXIN/LC, to visualize the information collected by said system in mobile devices and tablets. The fundamental objective is to develop a mobile application capable of visualizing the information of the ROFLEXIN/LC system in real time. For the development of the proposed solution, an analysis of the main tools, technologies and methodologies used in the construction of software is carried out. The process was guided by the use of the following tools and technologies: {\em Visual Paradigm} as a CASE tool, UML as a modeling language, JSON as a data exchange format, and Java as a programming language. Developed with the Eclipse IDE with the ADT extension. To validate that the results achieved were those expected, a set of tests was carried out. It was possible to correct all the detected non-conformities, which means that the proposed solution is ready to be deployed. Finally, a Viewer for mobile devices and tablets with Android operating system capable of representing in real time the information coming from the ROFLEXIN/LC system was obtained.
